# Terraform Backend Configuration Example
# Uncomment and configure if you want to use remote state storage
# This enables state locking and team collaboration

# terraform {
#   backend "azurerm" {
#     resource_group_name  = "rg-terraform-state"
#     storage_account_name = "stterraformstate"
#     container_name       = "tfstate"
#     key                  = "infrastructure.terraform.tfstate"
#   }
# }

# To use remote state:
# 1. Create a storage account for Terraform state
# 2. Create a container named "tfstate"
# 3. Uncomment and configure the backend block above
# 4. Run: terraform init -migrate-state
